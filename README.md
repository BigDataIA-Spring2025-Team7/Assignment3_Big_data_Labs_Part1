# Snowflake Data Engineering Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates various techniques for working with Snowflake, Snowpark, and related tools to build efficient data engineering pipelines, automate tasks, and manage Snowflake objects.

## Key Features
- **Ingesting Custom File Formats**: Learn how to ingest custom file formats (like Excel) from external stages (e.g., S3 buckets) into Snowflake tables using Snowpark.
- **Accessing Snowflake Marketplace Data**: Access data from Snowflake Marketplace and use it for analysis within your Snowflake environment.
- **Snowflake Notebooks & Snowpark DataFrame API**: Build data engineering pipelines using Snowflake Notebooks and Snowpark DataFrame API for efficient data processing.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate logging into your Python data engineering code and monitor it via Snowsight for effective tracking and debugging.
- **Executing SQL Scripts from Git**: Automate SQL script execution directly from your Git repository to interact with Snowflake.
- **Using Open-Source Python Libraries**: Utilize open-source Python libraries from the Snowflake curated Anaconda channel for enhanced functionality.
- **Snowflake Python Management API**: Programmatically interact with Snowflake objects using the Snowflake Python Management API.
- **Managing Snowflake Tasks with Python**: Automate and manage Snowflake Tasks using the Python Task DAG API.
- **Building CI/CD Pipelines**: Implement CI/CD pipelines using Snowflake's Git Integration, Snowflake CLI, and GitHub Actions for streamlined deployments.
- **Deploying Snowflake Notebooks**: Deploy Snowflake Notebooks from development to production environments to ensure smooth workflows.

## Prerequisites
- Snowflake account and access
- Snowpark setup for Python
- GitHub repository for CI/CD pipelines
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your Snowflake environment (Warehouse, Database, etc.).

Conclusion
---
This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for building and managing data pipelines within Snowflake using Snowpark and Python. By leveraging features such as external data ingestion, automated task management, and CI/CD pipelines, users can streamline their data engineering workflows and enhance their Snowflake experience. Whether you are working on small-scale analysis or large-scale production deployments, this repository provides the resources to optimize and automate key data processes.
